# Config

This repository contains v2ray configs that are expected to work to bypass the internet block in Iran.

> There is no guarantee that all the configs work for everyone.

## How the configs are selected

I copy and test a lot of configs (more than 2000) from various Telegram channels. The latency test URL is https://telegram.org/, and the ISP is MCI.

I don't remove the configs info tags, and strongly suggest to join the providers' channels.

> YOU **SHOUD NOT** RELY ON ME TO ALWAYS UPDATE THIS REPO. THIS REPO MAINLY SERVES AS A MORE COMFORTABLE TOOL TO HAVE WORKING CONFIGS ON MULTIPLE DEVICES OF "MINE"!

> I **DO NOT** OWN THE CONFIGS. I **AM NOT** RESPOSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE OR LOSS MADE BY THESE CONFIGS. I **AM NOT** A VPN PROVIDER.
